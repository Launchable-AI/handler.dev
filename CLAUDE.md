# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What is Handler?

Handler is a web application for spawning and managing isolated compute sandboxes. It provides a unified API/UI over multiple backends: Docker, Cloud-Hypervisor VMs, Firecracker microVMs, Daytona, and cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, DigitalOcean, Linode).

## Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Dev (runs server on :4001 and web on :5173 concurrently)
pnpm dev

# Dev individual packages
pnpm dev:server    # tsx watch packages/server/src/index.ts
pnpm dev:web       # vite dev server

# Build all
pnpm build

# Lint all
pnpm lint
```

Requires Node 22+. Uses pnpm workspaces.

## Testing

Uses **Vitest** for both packages. Server tests run in Node environment; web tests use happy-dom + @testing-library/react.

```bash
# Run all tests (both packages in parallel)
pnpm test

# Watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Coverage report
pnpm test:coverage

# Single package
pnpm --filter server test
pnpm --filter web test
```

### Conventions

- Test files live next to source in `__tests__/` directories (e.g., `src/lib/__tests__/validation.test.ts`)
- Use `.test.ts` for pure logic, `.test.tsx` for component tests
- Server tests can use `vi.mock()` for heavy dependencies (Docker, Hypervisor)
- Web component tests use the custom `render()` from `src/test/test-utils.tsx` which wraps QueryClientProvider
- Vitest globals (`describe`, `it`, `expect`, `vi`) are available without imports (configured in vitest configs)

## Architecture

### Adapter Pattern (core abstraction)

All sandbox operations go through a `SandboxAdapter` interface with backend-specific implementations. The coordinator in `packages/server/src/services/sandbox/index.ts` dispatches to the correct adapter based on the sandbox's `backend` field.

Adapters live in `packages/server/src/services/sandbox/` (docker, vm, daytona, aws, azure, gcp, digitalocean, linode). Heavy backend logic lives in dedicated service files under `packages/server/src/services/` (e.g., `hypervisor.ts`, `firecracker.ts`, `docker.ts`).

### Server

- **Routes** (`packages/server/src/routes/`): One file per resource (sandboxes, containers, vms, images, templates, volumes). Uses Hono + zod-validator.
- **Services** (`packages/server/src/services/`): Business logic. The sandbox service uses the adapter pattern; volume and template services are separate.
- **Types** (`packages/server/src/types/`): Shared TypeScript interfaces (`Sandbox`, `Volume`, `Template`) with a `backend` discriminator on Sandbox.

### Frontend

- **API client** (`packages/web/src/api/client.ts`): All endpoint definitions in one file.
- **Hooks** (`packages/web/src/hooks/`): React Query hooks (`useSandboxes`, `useContainers`, `useVolumes`, `useTemplates`).
- **Components** (`packages/web/src/components/`):
  - `sandbox/` — SandboxList, SandboxCard, CreateSandboxForm, SandboxFileBrowser
  - `Terminal/` — xterm.js integration with WebSocket, OSC 7337 escape sequences for shell state tracking
  - `TerminalPanel.tsx` — Terminal panel with tabs, horizontal split view, drag-and-drop tab assignment
  - `CommandCentre/` — Command palette
  - Canvas workspace uses ReactFlow for draggable terminal nodes
- **Path alias**: `@/*` maps to `packages/web/src/*`

### Terminal Session Persistence

Terminal sessions for Docker containers and VMs use **tmux** for persistence (configurable via `tmuxEnabled` in app config, default: `true`):
- Sessions survive WebSocket disconnects and server restarts
- Clients automatically reconnect to existing tmux sessions
- Scrollback history is restored on reconnection
- Session metadata stored in `data/terminal-sessions.json`
- A "tmux" badge appears in the terminal status bar with 3 states:
  - **Green**: connected to tmux session (persistence active)
  - **Orange**: tmux installed but detached (user detached or exited all panes, fell back to bare shell)
  - **Red**: tmux not installed (no persistence available)
  - Hidden when tmux persistence is disabled in config

The tmux badge is displayed in both the TerminalPanel popout (via its own internal TerminalInstance) and the Command Centre grid view (via `onTmuxStateChange` callback on `TerminalInstance` → `SessionTile` header). The `TerminalInstance` component handles `session-update` WebSocket messages from the server to track tmux state changes.

Key files:
- `packages/server/src/services/terminal.ts` — tmux-based terminal sessions (Docker)
- `packages/server/src/services/vm-terminal.ts` — tmux-based terminal sessions (VMs)
- `packages/server/src/services/session-store.ts` — session persistence
- `packages/web/src/components/Terminal/TerminalInstance.tsx` — auto-reconnection logic, tmux state via `onTmuxStateChange` callback
- `packages/web/src/components/CommandCentre/SessionTile.tsx` — tmux badge in Command Centre session tiles

For tmux persistence to work, containers/VMs must have `tmux` installed (the default.dockerfile and Firecracker images include it). When `tmuxEnabled` is set to `false` in config, plain shell sessions are used instead. The tmux status bar can be toggled via `tmuxStatusBar` in config (default: `false` / hidden).

### Terminal Theming

Terminal background supports independent dark/light mode control (can differ from the system theme):
- `packages/web/src/lib/terminal-themes.ts` — Dark and light xterm ITheme definitions, `TerminalThemeMode` type (`'dark' | 'light' | 'system'`)
- Terminal theme mode is stored in localStorage and can be set to System (follows app theme), Dark, or Light
- Shell init (`packages/server/src/services/shell-init.ts`) injects color aliases (`ls --color=auto`, `grep --color=auto`) and `dircolors` for colorized output

### Shell Prompt Themes

Six PS1 prompt themes: `minimal`, `clean`, `bracket`, `lambda`, `cyberpunk`, `multiline`. Configured via `shellPromptTheme` in app config.
- `packages/server/src/services/shell-init.ts` — Theme definitions (ANSI escape sequences) and shell initialization
- `packages/web/src/lib/prompt-themes.ts` — Preview definitions with dark/light color variants
- Themes are injected via stdin after shell start, with live-switching support
- Shell init is also persisted to `~/.config/handler/prompt.sh` and sourced from `.bashrc`, so new tmux panes/splits inherit the Handler prompt theme

### File Transfer

File upload, download, and browsing for all sandbox backends through a unified API:

- **Upload**: `POST /api/sandboxes/:id/upload` — multipart form upload to any backend
- **Directory upload**: `POST /api/sandboxes/:id/upload-directory` — tar-based batch upload
- **File listing**: `GET /api/sandboxes/:id/files?path=...` — list files in a directory (all backends)
- **Download**: `GET /api/sandboxes/:id/files/download?path=...` — download a single file from any backend

Backend-specific transport:
- Docker: `docker exec ls -la` for listing, `docker cp` for file transfer
- VMs (Firecracker/Cloud-Hypervisor): delegates to `listVmFiles()`/`downloadFileFromVm()` on the respective service (SSH/SCP-based)
- Daytona/AWS/Azure/GCP/DigitalOcean/Linode: SSH `ls -la` for listing, SCP for transfer with backend-specific SSH keys

The sandbox card/row actions include a download button (visible when running) that opens a file browser popover with directory navigation. Click a directory to navigate into it; click a file to download it.

Key files:
- `packages/server/src/routes/sandboxes.ts` — Unified upload/download/listing routes
- `packages/web/src/api/client.ts` — `listSandboxFiles`, `uploadFileToSandbox`, `downloadFileFromSandbox` client functions
- `packages/web/src/hooks/useSandboxes.ts` — `useSandboxFiles()` React Query hook
- `packages/web/src/components/sandbox/SandboxFileBrowser.tsx` — File browser popover component
- `packages/web/src/components/sandbox/SandboxCard.tsx` — File browser in card actions
- `packages/web/src/components/sandbox/SandboxRow.tsx` — File browser in table row actions
- `packages/web/src/components/sandbox/SandboxCardCompact.tsx` — File browser in compact card actions

### Docker in Firecracker

Firecracker VM images include Docker CE pre-installed. Docker uses a **dedicated ext4 block device** for `/var/lib/docker` so overlay2 works natively (avoiding nested overlayfs issues):

- **Custom kernel** (`scripts/dev/build-fc-kernel.sh`): Builds a Linux kernel with full Docker support (iptables, nf_tables, netfilter, overlay2, namespaces, cgroups) compiled as built-ins (`=y`), since Firecracker boots with `nomodule`
- **Boot args**: `acpi=off` is required — Firecracker's ACPI tables cause ACPI region initialization to fail, which breaks IRQ allocation for all virtio devices. `acpi=off` falls back to the legacy 8259 PIC which works correctly. This has no downside since Firecracker doesn't use ACPI for anything (device discovery is via virtio-mmio cmdline params, VM lifecycle is managed by the Firecracker API)
- **Dedicated Docker volume**: Each VM gets a separate ext4 block device mounted at `/var/lib/docker` by `overlay-init` at boot. This lets Docker use overlay2 directly on ext4 instead of nesting overlayfs-on-overlayfs
- **containerd bind mount**: `/var/lib/containerd` is bind-mounted onto `/var/lib/docker/containerd` (on the ext4 volume). Without this, containerd's overlayfs snapshotter fails because `/var/lib/containerd` would be on the guest's overlayfs root (overlay-on-overlay is not supported)
- **Boot-time config**: `guest-init/overlay-init` parses the `docker_volume=vdX` kernel boot arg, mounts the device via `/rom/dev/` (since `/dev` after pivot_root is the overlay's static `/dev`, not devtmpfs), and writes `/etc/docker/daemon.json` with `{"storage-driver":"overlay2"}`
- **Fallback**: The base image ships with `{"storage-driver":"vfs"}` in daemon.json as a fallback for VMs without a dedicated Docker volume
- Docker and containerd are disabled at boot; start manually with `sudo systemctl start docker`

Device assignment order: vda (rootfs) → parent layers (vdb, vdc...) → overlay (next) → docker volume (next) → data volumes (remaining)

Key files:
- `scripts/dev/build-fc-kernel.sh` — Custom kernel builder (Firecracker CI config + Docker fragment)
- `scripts/dev/prepare-fc-image.sh` — Image preparation (installs Docker CE, tmux, etc.)
- `guest-init/overlay-init` — In-guest init that sets up overlayfs, Docker volume, containerd bind mount, and SSH
- `packages/server/src/services/firecracker.ts` — VM creation with Docker volume allocation and `acpi=off` boot arg

### Security Hardening

The server is hardened against malicious agents inside sandboxes attempting to exploit the control-plane API. Three layers of defense:

1. **Network isolation**: The HTTP server binds to `127.0.0.1` only (`index.ts`), making the API unreachable from Docker bridge networks and VM TAP interfaces. Firewall rules in `scripts/setup.sh` provide defense in depth via iptables.

2. **Command injection elimination**: All shell commands that handle user-controlled data (uploaded filenames, file paths, sandbox IDs, VM IPs) use `execFileSync`/`execFile` with argument arrays instead of `execSync` with interpolated strings. This bypasses the shell entirely — no parsing, no expansion, no injection. See `packages/server/src/lib/safe-exec.ts` for the utility wrapper.

3. **Input validation**: All API inputs are validated at the boundary before reaching execution code. See `packages/server/src/lib/validation.ts` for validators (`validateSandboxId`, `validatePath`, `validateFilename`, `validateIpAddress`). Applied in route handlers (`sandboxes.ts`) and WebSocket message handlers (`index.ts`).

Key files:
- `packages/server/src/lib/safe-exec.ts` — Shell-free command execution utilities
- `packages/server/src/lib/validation.ts` — Input validation functions

When adding new `execSync` calls that handle user input, always use `execFileSync` with an argument array instead. When adding new API endpoints that accept IDs or paths, apply the validators from `validation.ts`.

### SSH Key Management

Global VM SSH keypair management for distributing Handler without bundling private keys:

- **Download**: `GET /api/ssh-keys/download` — returns the current private key as a PEM file
- **Regenerate**: `POST /api/ssh-keys/regenerate` — generates a new ed25519 keypair, returns the new private key
- Keys are stored at `data/ssh-keys/id_ed25519` (private) and `id_ed25519.pub` (public)
- All VM backends (Firecracker, Cloud-Hypervisor) share the same keypair
- UI: Settings > Self-Hosting tab has "Download Current Key" and "Regenerate Key" buttons
- Running VMs must be rebooted after regeneration for the new key to take effect

Key files:
- `packages/server/src/routes/ssh-keys.ts` — SSH key management endpoints
- `packages/web/src/api/client.ts` — `downloadGlobalSshKey()`, `regenerateSshKey()` client functions
- `packages/web/src/components/Settings.tsx` — VM SSH Key section in Self-Hosting tab

### Keyboard Shortcuts

A configurable keyboard shortcut system for terminal tab cycling and future actions:
- `packages/web/src/lib/keyboard-shortcuts.ts` — Shortcut definitions, localStorage storage, combo matching/formatting
- `packages/web/src/hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts.ts` — Global `window` keydown listener (capture phase) that intercepts before xterm/browser
- `packages/web/src/components/settings/KeyboardShortcutsSettings.tsx` — Settings panel for enable/disable toggle, remapping (click to record), and reset
- Settings > Keyboard tab in `packages/web/src/components/Settings.tsx`

Default shortcuts:
- `Ctrl+]` — Next terminal tab
- `Ctrl+[` — Previous terminal tab

User overrides stored in localStorage (`handler:shortcuts-enabled`, `handler:shortcuts`). The xterm `attachCustomKeyEventHandler` prevents the terminal from consuming shortcut keys. Add new shortcuts by appending to `SHORTCUT_DEFINITIONS` in `keyboard-shortcuts.ts`.

### Agent Detection

Detects AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode) installed/running inside sandboxes:
- `packages/server/src/services/agent-detect.ts` — Detection service using `command -v` + `pgrep -af`, with 15s in-memory cache
- `GET /api/sandboxes/:id/agents` — Endpoint in `packages/server/src/routes/sandboxes.ts`
- `packages/web/src/components/sandbox/AgentBadges.tsx` — SVG logo badges (grayed = installed, colored + pulse = running)
- `packages/web/src/hooks/useSandboxes.ts` — `useSandboxAgents()` hook (30s polling, only for running sandboxes)
- Badges displayed in `SandboxCard`, `SandboxCardCompact`, and `SandboxRow`
- The detection script uses `_dp=$$` + `grep -v` to exclude the script's own shell process from `pgrep` results (prevents false positives where all agents appear "running" because the detection script's command line contains all agent names). SSH detection passes the script directly as the remote command (no `sh -c` wrapper) since SSH already runs it through the user's shell.

### Image Builder (dev-only)

A UI tool for managing the VM image building pipeline, gated by `environment=development`. Brings the shell-script-based workflow (download, prepare, build kernel, upload) into the web UI with real-time SSE output streaming and the ability to shell into image filesystems via loop-mount + chroot.

**Environment gating**: The health endpoint returns `devMode: true` when `process.env.environment === 'development'`. Server routes reject with 403 otherwise. The nav entry only appears when `health.devMode` is true.

**Layer images**: Images created from VM snapshots have `layer.ext4` + `layer.json` instead of `rootfs.ext4`. The `layer.json` contains a `parent` field pointing to the base image. Layer images show a "Layer of {parent}" badge, have Prepare disabled (layers come from snapshots, not qcow2 conversion), and Shell opens a chroot into the partial layer filesystem. Upload handles layer images by compressing `layer.ext4` and uploading `layer.ext4.gz` + `layer.json` instead of `rootfs.ext4.gz` + `vmlinux`.

**Upload dialog**: Clicking Upload opens a confirmation dialog with AWS Profile (with autocomplete from `~/.aws/config`), S3 Bucket, S3 Region fields, a files preview, and destination path preview. Config is passed as env vars to `upload-fc-image.sh`.

**Shell flow**: Clicking Shell first tries `sudo -n mount` (non-interactive). If sudo requires a password, the UI shows the exact `sudo mount` command for the user to run in their terminal. After mounting manually, clicking Shell again detects the existing mount and opens the session. Uses a stable mount point (`/tmp/handler-image-{name}`) so manual mounts persist across retries. If `sudo -n chroot` is also unavailable, falls back to a plain shell cd'd to the mount point.

**Duplicate**: The Duplicate button creates a full copy of a base image (rootfs.ext4 + vmlinux) with a new name using `cp --reflink=auto --sparse=always`. This is the workflow for creating derivative images (e.g., `handler-dev` from `ubuntu-24.04`): duplicate, mount, shell in to install tools, upload as a new distributable image.

**Manifest management**: The global manifest (`scripts/dev/global-manifest.json`) tracks which images are available for distribution. Each image entry can have `"default": true` to mark it as the default for new installations. The Image Builder UI shows manifest badges on image cards and provides Add/Remove/Set Default controls. Manifest management functions: `readGlobalManifest()`, `addImageToManifest()`, `removeImageFromManifest()`, `setManifestDefault()`.

**Default image resolution**: The `defaultFirecrackerImage` config option in `AppConfig` overrides which base image is used when creating VMs without specifying a `baseImage`. The `download-image.sh` script resolves the default via: `HANDLER_DEFAULT_IMAGE` env var → manifest `default: true` entry → fallback `ubuntu-24.04`. The `setup.sh` script delegates to `download-image.sh` which handles the resolution.

**API endpoints** (all prefixed `/api/image-builder`, dev-mode middleware applied):
- `GET /` — list base images with file presence, sizes, and layer info
- `GET /aws-profiles` — list AWS CLI profiles from `~/.aws/config`
- `GET /manifest` — get the global manifest JSON
- `POST /manifest/add` — add image to manifest (body: `{ name, description, isDefault? }`)
- `POST /manifest/remove` — remove image from manifest (body: `{ name }`)
- `POST /manifest/set-default` — set default image in manifest (body: `{ name }`)
- `GET /:name` — inspect single image (includes filesystem info via dumpe2fs)
- `POST /:name/duplicate` — SSE: duplicate image (body: `{ name: destName }`)
- `POST /:name/prepare` — SSE: run `prepare-fc-image.sh --non-interactive`
- `POST /kernel/build` — SSE: run `build-fc-kernel.sh`
- `POST /:name/upload` — SSE: run `upload-fc-image.sh` (accepts `{ awsProfile, s3Bucket, s3Region }` body)
- `POST /:name/download` — SSE: run `download-image.sh`
- `GET /operations/list` — list active operations
- `POST /operations/:id/cancel` — cancel running operation

**WebSocket**: `start-image-shell` message type creates a chroot shell session into a `rootfs.ext4` or `layer.ext4` (fallback). Uses the `'image'` terminal target type.

Key files:
- `packages/server/src/services/image-builder.ts` — Image listing, inspection, operation execution, manifest CRUD
- `packages/server/src/services/image-shell.ts` — Loop-mount + chroot shell sessions
- `packages/server/src/routes/image-builder.ts` — Routes with dev-mode middleware
- `packages/web/src/hooks/useImageBuilder.ts` — React Query hooks
- `packages/web/src/components/ImageBuilder.tsx` — Main UI page with upload, duplicate, and manifest controls
- `packages/web/src/api/client.ts` — `listBuilderImages()`, `inspectBuilderImage()`, `listAwsProfiles()`, `prepareImage()`, `buildKernel()`, `uploadImage()`, `downloadBuilderImage()`, `duplicateImage()`, `getGlobalManifest()`, `addToManifest()`, `removeFromManifest()`, `setManifestDefault()` functions
- `scripts/dev/prepare-fc-image.sh` — Shell script with `--non-interactive` flag for server invocation
- `scripts/dev/upload-fc-image.sh` — Upload script with layer image detection and S3 config env vars
- `scripts/dev/global-manifest.json` — Global image manifest with `default` field support

### Dynamic Data Directory

The data directory is configurable via Settings > General > Data Directory. When changed, all services dynamically resolve paths using `getDataPath()` from `packages/server/src/services/data-dir.ts` instead of the static `DATA_DIR` constant.

- **`data-dir.ts`**: Central helper with `getDataDir()`, `getDataPath(...segments)`, and `reloadServices(newDataDir)` — reads `config.dataDirectory` from config, falls back to `DATA_DIR`
- **Service pattern**: Each service that stores data (quick-files, notes, agent-config, mcp-registry, mcp-deploy, session-store) uses `async getDataFile() { return getDataPath('filename.json'); }` instead of a hardcoded `const DATA_FILE = join(...)`. Each exports a `resetXxxCache()` function.
- **Singleton services** (template, vm-volumes): Export `resetXxxService()` that nulls the singleton so it re-creates with the new data dir on next access.
- **Route files** (dockerfiles, agent-config, ssh-keys): Use `async getXxxDir() { return getDataPath('subdir'); }` called in each handler.
- **Config route** (`routes/config.ts`): PATCH handler detects `dataDirectory` changes, calls `reloadServices()`, and returns a `_dataDirScan` object with item counts.
- **Frontend** (`Settings.tsx`): After save, reads `_dataDirScan` from the response, invalidates React Query caches, and shows an inline notification with what was loaded.

What stays on the static `DATA_DIR`: `config.json` itself (bootstrap file), VM infrastructure paths (firecracker-vms, base-images), and cloud provider SSH keys.

When adding new services that store data, use `getDataPath()` from `data-dir.ts` and export a cache reset function.
